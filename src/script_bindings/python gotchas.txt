shared libraries, need to explicitly give the lib to link as well as the directory

python modules must be named whatever their filename is .pyd and in python must be imported from that file name.
ex: anh_python.pyd
import anh_python

anh_python.vec3(1,2,3)


overloading members:
python doesn't like a reference returned.
